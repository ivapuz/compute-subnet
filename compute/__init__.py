# TODO feat(Validators/Miners): Random hashes used for challenge ? maybe not necessary thanks to Blake algo.
# TODO feat(Miners): Remove docker requirement, to support containerized providers.
# TODO tech-debt: Rename Perfinfo into hardware info or specs info (but as long as it is not used to tests the perfs, IMO name is incorrect.
# TODO tech-debt: Run black everywhere. Use Classes instead of big main and unclassified methods.
# TODO tech-debt: Replace miner file to use a Miner class.
